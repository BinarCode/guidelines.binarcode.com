<p class="my-4">This site contains a set of guidelines we use to bring our projects to a good end. We decided to document our workflow because consistency is one of the most valuable traits of maintainable software.</p>

<p class="my-4">This documentation exists to improve ourselves and for giving future colleagues a reference to our way of doing things. The guidelines cover git workflow, code style & guidelines, testing and other little things we consider worth documenting in order to help us provide stable, consistent and high quality software.</p>

All pages are written in markdown and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/BinarCode/guidelines.binarcode.com), so edits and improvements are welcome. Take into consideration that the things mentioned here are reflect our own workflow and ideas, therefore we might be nitpicking on substantial changes.
