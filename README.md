# Preface

### This site contains a set of guidelines we use to bring our projects to a good end. We decided to document our workflow because consistency is one of the most valuable traits of maintainable software.

This documentation exists to improve ourselves and for giving future colleagues a reference to our way of doing things.
The guidelines cover git workflow, code style & guidelines, testing and other little things we consider worth documenting in order to help us provide stable, consistent and high quality software.

All pages are written in markdown and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/BinarCode/guidelines.binarcode.com), so edits and improvements are welcome.
Take into consideration that the things mentioned here are reflect our own workflow and ideas, therefore we might be nitpicking on substantial changes.
